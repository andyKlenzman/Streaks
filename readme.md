# Daily Do Do
Daily Doo Doo is a super simple accountability tool.

It works just like streaks on snapchat. You and a friend build a streak together. If one person does not do it in time, it fails.

Built on simplicity, focusing on the main functionality of facilitating these streaks between users for themselves and for the local users.
